List of operators

1.Arithmetic Operators:

Addition: +
Subtraction: -
Multiplication: *
Division: /
Floor Division: //
Modulus (Remainder): %
Exponentiation: **

2.Comparison (Relational) Operators:

Equal to: ==
Not equal to: !=
Greater than: >
Less than: <
Greater than or equal to: >=
Less than or equal to: <=

3.Assignment Operators:

Assign: =
Add and Assign: +=
Subtract and Assign: -=
Multiply and Assign: *=
Divide and Assign: /=
Floor Divide and Assign: //=
Modulus and Assign: %=
Exponentiate and Assign: **=

4.Logical Operators:

AND: and
OR: or
NOT: not

5.Bitwise Operators:

Bitwise AND: &
15 binary number is 1111.
7 binary number is 0111.
1 & 0 = 0
1 & 1 = 1
1 & 1 = 1
1 & 1 = 1
So, the result of bitwise AND (&) operation is 0111 in binary, which is 7 in decimal.
In this example, the bitwise AND of 15 and 7 is 7.

Bitwise OR: |
Bitwise XOR: ^
Bitwise NOT: ~
Left Shift: <<
Right Shift: >>

6.Membership Operators:

In: in
Not In: not in

7.Identity Operators:

Is: is
Is Not: is not
