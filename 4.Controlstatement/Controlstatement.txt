1.Conditional Statements:
if: Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.
elif: Stands for "else if". It's used to define additional conditions to test if the previous conditions are false.
else: Executes a block of code if none of the preceding conditions are true.
Example:

x = 10
if x > 0:
    print("x is positive")
elif x < 0:
    print("x is negative")
else:
    print("x is zero")



***************************************
2.Loops:
for: Iterates over a sequence (e.g., list, tuple, string) or other iterable objects.
while: Executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.


Example (for loop):
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)


Example (while loop):
i = 1
while i < 6:
    print(i)
    i += 1




***************************************
3.Control Flow Statements:
break: Terminates the loop statement it is inside.
continue: Skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration, then continues with the next iteration.
pass: Used when a statement is required syntactically but you do not want any command or code to execute.


Example (break):
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
    if fruit == "banana":
        break
 

Example (continue):
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    if fruit == "banana":
        continue
    print(fruit)

    
Example (pass):
x = 10
if x > 0:
    pass  # Placeholder for future code
else:
    print("x is not positive")
